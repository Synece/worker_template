# Queue Worker Examples Repository

Welcome to the Queue Worker Examples repository! This repository is designed as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to integrate queue-based messaging into their applications using various technologies. Each directory within this repository contains a complete, standalone example of how to set up a worker for a specific queue system.

## Available Examples

Currently, this repository includes the following examples:

### GCP Pub/Sub

- **Location**: `GCP-PubSub/`
- **Description**: This example demonstrates how to set up a worker that listens to messages on a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic and processes those messages accordingly.

Additional examples for other queue systems are under development and will be added to this repository in the future.

## Upcoming Examples

We are actively working on adding more examples for the following queue systems:

- **RabbitMQ**
- **AWS SQS**
- **Azure Service Bus**
- **Kafka**

Each example will be placed in its own directory, similar to the existing GCP Pub/Sub example.

## Getting Started

To get started with an example, navigate to the specific directory for the queue system you are interested in, and follow the README.md instructions within that directory.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin with any specific example, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12.x or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

Each specific example might have additional prerequisites, which will be listed in the individual README files.
